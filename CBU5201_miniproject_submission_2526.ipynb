    "# 2 Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a machine learning system that can automatically identify the song being performed in a short audio recording of humming or whistling. Given an input audio signal, the model predicts the corresponding song label from a predefined set of songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is formulated as a supervised multi-class classification problem. Each audio recording belongs to exactly one song class, and the number of classes corresponds to the number of unique songs present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is interesting because humming and whistling recordings are highly variable across users and recording conditions. Unlike studio music recordings, these signals often lack clear harmonic structure and may contain noise, pitch instability, and rhythm variations. Successfully classifying such signals therefore requires robust feature extraction and carefully designed machine learning models.\n"

    "# 3 Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This project treats song identification from humming and whistling as a supervised multi-class classification problem. The methodology is built around capturing robust acoustic signatures from highly variable vocal signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the model focuses on melodic patterns rather than recording noise, a hybrid feature extraction strategy was adopted, combining spectral (MFCCs) and tonal (Chroma) information. The core of my approach is to compare a diverse set of classifiers—ranging from linear models to non-linear tree ensembles—to identify which decision boundaries best fit the irregular nature of human humming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, since the task is inherently ambiguous, I utilized a Soft Voting Ensemble to aggregate predictive confidences from multiple models, aiming to achieve more stable generalisation. Performance is analyzed not only through standard Accuracy but also via Top-3 Accuracy, which provides a more nuanced measure of the model's ability to recognize the \"potential\" song in a real-world retrieval scenario.\n"

    "# 4 Implemented ML prediction pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the song recognition task, I developed a pipeline that moves from raw audio processing to an ensemble of classifiers. Instead of relying on a single model, this approach combines different algorithms to handle the variability of humming and whistling sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is divided into three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transformation: Raw 10-second audio clips are preprocessed and converted into a 60-dimensional feature vector using MFCCs and other spectral descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Training: I implemented three different classifiers: SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. These models were chosen to provide a diverse range of decision-making strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble: The final predictions are made using a Soft Voting Classifier, which pools the results from all three models to achieve more stable performance on the test set."

    "\n",
    "### Input and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "A single audio file containing a 10-second humming or whistling recording, sampled at 22,050 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "A fixed-length feature vector with 60 dimensions representing the audio signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Extraction Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To comprehensively characterise the properties of the audio signal, a combination of complementary audio features is extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**\n",
    "- 20 MFCC coefficients are extracted.\n",
    "- The mean and standard deviation of each coefficient are computed, resulting in 40 dimensions.\n",
    "- MFCCs effectively capture the spectral envelope of audio signals and are among the most widely used features in speech and music recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Chroma Features**\n",
    "- The mean of 12 chroma coefficients is extracted.\n",
    "- Chroma features represent pitch class information and are particularly useful for melody-related tasks.\n",
    "- Notes played in different octaves share similar chroma representations, making this feature robust to pitch shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Spectral Contrast**\n",
    "- The mean of 7 spectral contrast coefficients is extracted.\n",
    "- Spectral contrast captures the difference between spectral peaks and valleys.\n",
    "- This feature is helpful for distinguishing timbral characteristics across different audio signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)**\n",
    "- The mean zero crossing rate (1 dimension) is extracted.\n",
    "- ZCR reflects the frequency of signal sign changes and is useful for distinguishing voiced and unvoiced segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-feature representation is chosen for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complementarity**: Different features describe the audio signal from different perspectives. MFCCs capture global spectral characteristics, chroma features represent pitch-related information, and spectral contrast captures timbral differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Humming and whistling recordings exhibit high variability across participants and recording conditions. Combining multiple features improves model robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moderate Dimensionality**: The resulting 60-dimensional feature vector is expressive enough to represent the audio signal without introducing excessive dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational Efficiency**: All features can be efficiently extracted using the librosa library, making the approach suitable for batch processing."

    "In this step, audio features and corresponding song labels are extracted for all audio files. A unified feature extraction function is defined to convert each audio signal into a fixed-length numerical representation. All audio files are resampled to 22,050 Hz and normalized to a fixed duration of 10 seconds. MFCCs are extracted and summarized using their mean and standard deviation, while chroma features, spectral contrast, and zero-crossing rate are summarized using their mean values. \n",

    "**Base Models:**\n",
    "- SVM (captures complex non-linear relationships)\n",
    "- Logistic Regression (captures linear decision boundaries)\n",
    "- Random Forest (models non-linear feature interactions and is robust to noise through ensemble averaging)\n",
    "**Soft Voting Mechanism:**\n",
    "- Each model outputs class probabilities.\n",

    "# 6 Experiments and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Experiment code \n",
    "  All experiments in this project are conducted using the code presented in the earlier sections of this notebook. \n",
    "In particular, data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and ensemble construction are implemented and executed in Sections 4.1–4.3 as part of a complete and reproducible machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "## 6.2 Results Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental results evaluate the performance of different classification models on the song identification task using the proposed audio feature representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Representation Effectiveness**  \n",
    "   The extracted feature set, combining MFCC statistics, chroma features, spectral contrast, and zero-crossing rate, provides a compact yet expressive representation of the audio signals. This feature combination captures spectral, harmonic, and temporal characteristics of the recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Performance Comparison**  \n",
    "   Both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression achieve similar test accuracies (20.0%). The Random Forest model attains a lower top-1 accuracy (16.67%) but achieves the highest Top-3 accuracy (60.0%), indicating that it frequently ranks the correct song among the most likely predictions even when the top prediction is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensemble Performance**  \n",
    "   The Ensemble model achieves the highest top-1 test accuracy (23.33%), demonstrating a modest improvement over individual classifiers. The soft-voting ensemble demonstrates a modest improvement over single models. This suggests that combining linear and non-linear classifiers can enhance robustness, although the overall gain remains limited given the dataset size.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Top-3 Accuracy**  \n",
    "   For all models, Top-3 accuracy is substantially higher than standard accuracy. In particular, the Random Forest model achieves the highest Top-3 accuracy (60.0%), highlighting its strength in ranking plausible candidate songs even when exact classification is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training and Generalisation Behaviour**  \n",
    "   The relatively low absolute accuracy values reflect the difficulty of the task and the limited dataset size (400 samples). The similar performance across training, validation, and test sets suggests that severe overfitting is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**  \n",
    "   The confusion matrices reveal that certain songs are frequently confused with one another, likely due to similarities in melodic structure or performance style (e.g., whistling and humming variations).\n"

    "# 7 Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.1 Main Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all experiments, the complete pipeline of handcrafted audio features plus classical classifiers achieved modest accuracy on the 8-way song identification task: the soft-voting ensemble reached the highest test top-1 accuracy of 23.33% and the Random Forest delivered the best Top-3 accuracy of 60.0%. These results show that the combined spectral and cepstral features carry enough information to rank the correct song among the leading candidates, but stronger sequential modelling and richer data are needed to improve exact recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.2 Limitations and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited performance**: Although performance exceeds random guessing (12.5% for 8 classes), absolute accuracy remains low; Top-3 accuracy of up to 60.0% suggests the models often rank the correct label near the top but struggle to select it reliably.\n",
    "- **Feature representation**: Handcrafted spectral and cepstral statistics may miss melodic progression and rhythm, limiting the models' ability to disambiguate similar songs or capture temporal cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.3 Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More data**: Use the larger 800-sample dataset and apply data augmentation techniques.\n",
    "- **Improved features**:\n",
    "  - Sequential features using LSTM or Transformer models\n",
    "  - Pitch trajectories and rhythmic features\n",

    "## 7.4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigated the problem of song identification from short audio recordings using classical machine learning methods and handcrafted audio features. A complete pipeline was implemented, including feature extraction, model training, ensemble learning, and evaluation on a small multi-class dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental results show that all models achieve relatively low absolute top-1 accuracy due to the difficulty of the task and the limited dataset size. The soft-voting ensemble achieves the highest test accuracy (23.33%), while the Random Forest model attains the strongest Top-3 accuracy (60.0%). This indicates that although exact classification remains challenging, the learned representations frequently rank the correct song among the most plausible candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results highlight both the potential and the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches for this task. While performance is constrained by data size and feature representation, the findings provide useful insights and motivate the use of richer data, sequential modelling, and more advanced architectures in future work.\n",
